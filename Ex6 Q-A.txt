		Exercise 6 Questions and answers

Q2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string.

	types_of_people = 10
	x = "There are #{types_of_people} types of people."
	binary = "binary"
	do_not = "don't"
	y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."  // Line 1 @2places

	puts x
	puts y

	puts "I said: #{x}."					// Line 2
	puts "I also said: '#{y}'."				// Line 3

	hilarious = false
	joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"

	puts joke_evaluation

	w = "This is the left side of..."
	e = "a string with a right side."

	puts w + e

  Ans : In 4 places, a string is put insided an another string.


Q3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.

  Ans : Sure, it's in four places only.


Q4. Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.

  Ans : '+' operator in string is used as an concatenation operator. It means the second string is added
	to the first string and thus makes a new string which seems to be a longer string.


Q5. What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single-quote) instead of " (double-quote)? 
    Do they still work? Try to guess why.

  Ans : Single quotes and double quotes both were used to store string values.
	Using in variables if we change it works as such.

	Single quotes doesn't holds any escape characters, but double quotes can hold.
	Single quotes cannot work with string interpolation, but double quotes can work with string interpolation.
