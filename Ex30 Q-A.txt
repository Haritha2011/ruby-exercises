	Exercise 30 study drill Questions and Answers

Q1. Try to guess what elsif and else are doing.

  Ans First the condition for ‘if’ is evaluated,if it is true then the code inside if block gets executed.
      (Immediately it reachthe end of statement by skipping other elsif statements)  
      If it is false, the next condition ‘elseif’ is evaluated, if that is true then the code inside if block 
      gets executed. 
      If both the two conditions gets failed, then the block under ‘else’ will get executed.

Q2. Change the numbers of cars, people, and trucks and then trace through each if-statement to see 
    what will be printed.

  Ans If we change cars = 10, people = 20, trucks = 30, 
      then cars < people will be true, 
           trucks > cars will be true, and 
           people < trucks will be false. 
      Therefore, line 10, line 25, and line 44 will gets executed and the according statements will
      gets printed.
